# Counter in React Redux

 $ cd react-redux-counter/counter
 $ npm install
 $ npm start
```

## Using .disptach

## Using .subscribe

## Using .getState with Component composition props

Redux is managing our application's state via the store.
Since that is the case, we're going to be obtaining the state from the store via `getState` constantly.
This might seem like a pain in the neck, but in reality it gives incredible control over our app.
This is what gives us the ability to see the data in our application playing like a movie that we can pause, rewind, and fast-forward.

We are going to be passing information about the application's state from the store in to a component's props.
